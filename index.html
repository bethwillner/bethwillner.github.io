            <p>Hi! I'm Beth! I'm currently pursuing two associate degrees in software development and web development and design. I spent a year at UW-Stevens Point doing Graphic Design but wasn't really sure if that was the field for me and decided to tranfer to the tech to get a more affordable education as I just wasn't sure what I wanted to do at the time! The tech has been a great choice for me and I've had a great learning experience so far!</p>
            <p>My favorite movies and shows are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Titanic</li>
                    <li>The Hunger Games Series</li>
                    <li>Vampire Diaries</li>
                    <li>Adventure Time</li>
                    <li>Gravity Falls</li>
                    <li>The Fallout</li>
                </ul>
